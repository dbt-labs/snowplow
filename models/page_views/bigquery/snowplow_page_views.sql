    General approach: find sessions that happened since the last time
    the model was processed. The naive approach just grabs events that
    happened on or after this date, but we can miss events that bridge
    midnight. Instead, we fetch an extra day of events, but only consider
    the sessions that occur on or after the start_date. The extra lookback
    day will give us the full picture of events, but we won't reprocess the extra
    events from the previous day unless they are present on the `start_date`.
